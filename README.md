# RISC-V
Implementation of RISC-V architecture using Verilog. The architecture is of single process without pipelining. 


To write the command/ code to the processor
1.Add the up code to the reg mem[] located inside of instructionmemory.v


To run the code 
1. Run the file Single_Cycle_Tb.v
2. Observe the output on the gtvwave
